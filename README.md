# harvard-mit-climateclock
GOV 1318's Climate Clock Team continued the MIT Climate Clock project, https://web.mit.edu/climateclock/, on Harvard's campus during the Spring 2023 semester. 

In this repository, you can find and reuse/edit the code used to create the 2 banner projection on Lehman Hall on April 21, 2023. Part of this code comes from the existing MIT Climate Clock team's repository as noted in the code comments: https://github.com/alejandrodiazz/climatesign.
